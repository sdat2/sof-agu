## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Getting started

 - Make the environment:

    ```
    make env
    ```

 - Activate the environment:

     ```
     make ./env
     ```

 - Make the documentation and load it in your web browser:

    ```
    make docs
    ```


 - Make your Jupyter notebooks more functional with timings etc.:

    ```
    make jupyter_pro
    ```

- To see the other options in the `Makefile` type:

    ```
    make help
    ```
