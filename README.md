## Short description

In the Southern Ocean, fronts delineate water masses, which correspond to upwelling
and downwelling branches of the overturning circulation. Classically, oceanographers
define Southern Ocean fronts as a small number of continuous linear features that
encircle Antarctica. However, modern observational and theoretical developments are
challenging this traditional framework to accommodate more localized views of fronts
[Chapman et al. 2020].

Here we present code for implementing two related methods for calculating fronts from
oceanographic data. The first method uses unsupervised classification (specifically,
Gaussian Mixture Modeling or GMM) and a novel interclass metric to define fronts.
This approach produces a discontinuous, probabilistic view of front location,
emphasising the fact that the boundaries between water masses are not uniformly sharp
across the entire Southern Ocean.

The second method uses Sobel edge detection to highlight rapid changes [Hjelmervik & Hjelmervik, 2019].
This approach produces a more local view of fronts, with the advantage that it can highlight the movement
of individual eddy-like features (such as the Agulhas rings).

## Getting started

- Make the environment:

    ```bash
    make env
    ```

- Activate the environment in conda:

     ```bash
     conda activate ./env
     ```

- Change the settings in `src.constants` to set download location etc.

- Download data (`get_zip`  1694.64639 s):

   ```bash
   python3 src/data_loading/bsose_download.py
   ```

- Make I-metric:

   ```bash
   python3 src/models/batch_i_metric.py
   ```

- Make figures:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
