Abstract
========

In this work, we present two related methods for calculating fronts from oceanographic data.
fronts, with the advantage that it can highlight the movement of individual eddy-like
features (such as the Agulhas rings). We will present our python GitHub repository, which
will allow researchers to easily apply these methods to their own datasets.
