Abstract
========

 In this work, we present two related methods for calculating fronts from oceanographic data. fronts, with the advantage that it can highlight the movement of individual eddy-like features (such as the Agulhas rings). We will present our python GitHub repository, which will allow researchers to easily apply these methods to their own datasets.
