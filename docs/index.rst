Home - sof-agu Documentation
==============================
Welcome to the seager19 documentation!

This webpage/document explores the code and data 
used in the sof-agu project, and some of the 
motivations for different choices made. The 
first section `sof-agu` contains the main 
`README.md` of the repository, so as to reduce duplication,
and this should provide a reasonable introduction to the 
repository as a whole.
